# Container With Most Water

Given _n_ non-negative integers _a1_, _a2_, ..., _an_, where each represents a point at coordinate _(i, ai)_. _n_ vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line _i_ is at _(i, ai)_ and _(i, 0)_. Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container.

# Solution

_O(n^2)_ solution is pretty easy to figure out. _O(n)_ solution is
really fascinating.
