# Maximal Rectangle

Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing all ones and return its area.

# Solution

O(n^2) time complexity.

Brute force algorithm is very time consuming.

We can use the algorithm in the previous problem [largest rectangle in histogram](https://github.com/weiweicse/cracking_the_coding_interview/tree/master/largest_rectangle_in_histogram) to solve this problem.
