# Price Difference

Consider two time series. Each time series contains price and time. Time
is expressed in number of seconds since market open. Every time when
price changes - there is a new entry into time series.

Write a program that receives two inputs: time series 1 and 2,
calculates another time series containing the price difference (spread)
between the two products at fixed 10 seconds interval.
