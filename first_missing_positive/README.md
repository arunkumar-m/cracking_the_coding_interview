# First Missing Positive

Given an unsorted integer array, find the first missing positive integer.

For example,

Given [1,2,0] return 3,

and [3,4,-1,1] return 2.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant space.

## Solution

Pretty trivial to do it using O(n) space but it is hard to run in O(n)
while only using constant space.

Future work: implement this algorithm with constant space.
